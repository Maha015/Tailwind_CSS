        <p class="p-3 text-red-400">Recent discoveries of record-breaking quasars have pushed the boundaries of our understanding. In 2021, astronomers reported the most distant quasar ever seen and, in 2024, the most luminous quasar known. The most distant quasar shone less than a billion years after the universeâ€™s birth, which means that its black hole grew up in a hurry. Did the black hole start small and rapidly swallow lots of new material, or did the black hole begin life big and grow even bigger? Meanwhile, the most luminous quasar demonstrates just how quickly a black hole can swallow gas and grow larger. Because supermassive black holes reside at the centers of most large galaxies, including our own, similar processes likely once affected the central regions of large galaxies throughout the cosmos.</p>
