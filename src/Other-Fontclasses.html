    <h1 class="text-4xl">ChatGPT</h1>
    <span class="leading-10">Unlike <span class="font-bold">Google, ChatGPT</span> doesn’t crawl the web for information on current events, and its knowledge is restricted to things it learned before 2021, making some of its answers feel stale. <span class="italic font-mono">(When I asked it to write the opening monologue for a late-night show, for example, it came up with several topical jokes about former President Donald J. Trump pulling out of the Paris climate accords.) </span>Since its training data includes billions of examples of human opinion,</span> representing every conceivable view, <span class="text-blue-600">it’s also, in some sense, a moderate by design. Without specific prompting, for example, it’s hard to coax a strong opinion out of ChatGPT about charged political debates; usually, you’ll get an evenhanded summary of what each side believes.</span>
